# The Translation Transition: Mathematical Modeling of Timelines for Migration to Large Language Models in Translation Services

## Overview

This research looks into the timeline when Large Language Models (LLMs) will take the place of human translators in text-to-text translation tasks, as a case study, the document explores Swedish-English bidirectional translation.

## Research Question

**Primary Research Question**: What is the projected timeline for Large Language Models to replace human-like workforce in text-to-text translation tasks, specifically for Swedish-English bidirectional translation?

**Secondary Research Questions**:
1. What metrics effectively measure the advancement of LLMs in translation quality?
2. How can mathematical models predict the evolution of translation capabilities in LLMs?
3. What are the key factors determining the transition from human to AI-driven translation?

## Components to Address

### Metrics for LLM Translation Evaluation
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Automated metric comparing machine translation to human reference
- **ROUGE**: Recall-oriented evaluation for translation quality
- **METEOR**: Metric considering synonyms and stemming
- **BERTScore**: Contextual embeddings-based evaluation
- **GEMBA (GPT Estimation Metric Based Assessment)**: Recent LLM-based quality assessment
- **Human Evaluation Metrics**: Fluency, adequacy, and post-editing effort

### Mathematical Modeling Approaches
- **Performance Growth Curves**: Logarithmic and exponential models
- **Quality Threshold Models**: Statistical significance testing
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Economic models for adoption timeline
- **Probability Distribution Models**: Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty

### Industry Benchmarks and Datasets
- **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation)** shared tasks
- **OPUS corpus** for parallel text evaluation
- **Swedish-English specific datasets**
- **Domain-specific translation benchmarks**

## Timeline Prediction Framework

Based on current industry predictions and research findings, this document will develop a mathematical framework for predicting the timeline when human translators become non-essential for text-to-text translation tasks.

## Expected Contributions

1. Novel mathematical model for predicting LLM translation capability evolution
2. Evaluation framework for Swedish-English translation quality
3. Evidence-based timeline projection for human translator displacement
4. Policy recommendations for translation industry transition
