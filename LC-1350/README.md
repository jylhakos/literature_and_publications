## Research Findings

The calibrated Monte Carlo simulation generates results consistent with the research paper findings based on 10,000 iterations:

### Primary Timeline Predictions
- Technical Threshold (90% performance achievement): Q4 2026 (median: 13.0 months from baseline)
- Market Displacement (75% industry adoption): Q2 2027 (median: 21.4 months from baseline)
- Complete Industry Transformation: Projected completion by 2027-2028

### Scenario Analysis
- Optimistic scenario (10th percentile): Q4 2026
- Most probable scenario (50th percentile): Q2 2027
- Conservative scenario (90th percentile): Q1 2028

### Risk Assessment Metrics
- Probability of technical threshold achievement by end 2025: 2.2%
- Probability of market disruption by mid-2026: 25.9%
- Expected cost reduction range: 60-80% relative to human translation services

## Methodological Framework

The simulation implements a six steps Monte Carlo methodology:

### Step 1: Uncertain Variable Identification
- Quality improvement rate: Normal distribution N(0.15, 0.05) per annum
- Human performance baseline: Normal distribution N(0.95, 0.02)
- Economic adoption threshold: Uniform distribution U(0.80, 0.90)
- Market adoption lag time: Exponential distribution

### Step 2: Probability Distribution Assignment
Following research paper section 4.4.1 specifications:
- Normal distributions for translation quality metrics
- Uniform distributions for economic threshold parameters
- Exponential distributions for market adoption lag variables

### Step 3: Mathematical Model Construction
- Logistic Growth Model: Quality(t) = 0.95 / (1 + e^(-0.45(t-4.2)))
- Economic Adoption Model: Adoption(t) = 0.85 / (1 + e^(-(Quality(t) - threshold)/σ))

### Step 4: Simulation Execution
- 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations for statistical significance
- Probabilistic sampling from established distributions
- Timeline calculation algorithms for quality threshold achievement

### Step 5: Statistical Analysis
- Confidence interval computation for all predictions
- A risk assessment and scenario modeling
- Sensitivity analysis for critical model parameters

### Step 6: Forecasting Application
- Evidence-based strategic recommendations for industry stakeholders
- Probabilistic timeline predictions with quantified uncertainty
- Risk mitigation strategies and contingency planning frameworks
