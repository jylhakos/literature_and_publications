Research Scope: Evaluating Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI Agent Interactions

Abstract

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of interacting with external tools and services
traditionally requires implementing custom integration logic for each API, managing authentication methods,
and handling error response formats. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in November 2024,
states that a paradigm shift toward standardized, protocol-driven AI-tool communication. However, empirical
research quantifying MCP's transformative impact on development practices and agent capabilities remains absent.
This study explorers how the development of AI agents is transformed by MCP adoption. Specifically,
the research analyzes whether MCP integration leads to reduced development time and improved AI agent
capabilities compared to traditional API integration approaches. The research employs an experimental work
with randomized controlled trials comparing MCP-based development (treatment) against traditional API integration
(control) using the Arcee Agent model (7B parameter function-calling small language model). This research provides
the empirical evaluation of MCP's transformative impact on AI agent development. Findings will inform
software engineering practices, guide protocol adoption decisions, and advance understanding of how standardization
shapes development workflows and AI agent capabilities.

Research Problem

How the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents is transformed by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Research Question

Does Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration lead to reduced development time and improved AI agent capabilities compared
to traditional API integration approaches?

The research explores whether MCP adoption (a) transforms development practices by decreasing implementation time,
reducing code complexity, and minimizing integration effort, and (b) enhances AI agent operational capabilities
measured by task completion rates, tool invocation success, and system efficiency in Arcee Agent model based applications.

Research Problem Context

The landscape of AI agent development is undergoing rapid evolution, with emerging protocols proposing
new paradigms for tool integration and context management. Traditional approaches require developers to
implement custom integration logic for each external service, manage authentication schemes, and
handle error responses. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) presents a approach as follows: A standardized,
protocol-driven framework for AI-tool communication. This transformation encompasses multiple dimensions from
development workflows and code architecture to AI agent runtime behavior and operational characteristics.
However, empirical validation of MCP's transformative states that across these dimensions remains absent,
creating uncertainty about the practical effects of protocol adoption.

Conclusion

This research proposal outlines a confirmatory experimental study to evaluate
the integration of Model Context Protocol with the Arcee Agent model. The study
tests hypotheses regarding performance, efficiency, and reliability 
improvements resulting from MCP integration.
